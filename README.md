## Description 
*Overview of this project:* <br>
Dark Horse is an app that allows bands to see the location of their fans. Fans will be asked to check in on a map so that artists can then see what cities they have the most fans in. After the cities are located the bands can use this information to help them to map out a successful tour. 

## Future Functionality
Bands will be able to crowdfund ticket sales in advance of a tour to make sure it will be a viable tour before they head out on the road. 
* Shows will go on a preliminary pre-sale that is only confirmed after they reach the ticket threashold. 
* When a fan buys a preliminary pre-sale ticket, a temporary hold will be placed on a fans credit card. 
* If the city reaches the ticket threshold needed to book the date then the show will be confirmed and all holds on credit cards will be charged.
* If the ticket threshold is never reached then the date will be canceled and all holds will be removed from credit cards. 

## Installation
*Steps required to install project and get the development environment established:*
* Simply use the npm install command in your terminal to install all necessary packages to launch Laura's website application!

## Usage

    3. In the future there will be functionality for the fan to buy a preliminary pre-sale ticket for thier city.
